# Regression_models

In this repo we explore the " https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions " Kaggle dataset, 
which consists of several parameters that are considered important for a student in their application for Masters Programs. 

The task is to build a regressor that predicts the proability a student to get admitted to the university of interest.
 
We build regression models using Recurrent neural networks, linear OLS regression, linear Ridge regression and the k-NN algorithm.
In the end, we compare the models based on the MSE, which indicates by how much on average a model fails to predict the correct values.

The code file "regression_models" is structured as follows :
1. The dataset - Correlations
2. RNN regressor
3. Linear OLS regressor
4. Linear Ridge regressor
5. k-NN regressor
6. Summary / Models comparisons
7. Additional approaches to try in future repos
