# Regression_models

In this repo we explore the " https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions " Kaggle dataset, 
which consists of several parameters that are considered important for a student in their application for Masters Programs. 

The task is to predict the proability a student to get admitted to the University of interest.
 
We build regression models using Recurrent neural networks, linear OLS regression and the k-NN algorithm 
and compare the models based on the MSE, which indicates by how much on average a model fails to predict the correct values.

The code file "regression_models" is structured as follows :
1. The dataset - Correlations
2. RNN regressor
3. Linear OLS regressor
4. k-NN regressor
5. Summary / Models comparisons
